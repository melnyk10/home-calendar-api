# Home Calendar

[Home Calendar](https://omeln.atlassian.net/wiki/x/xIAD) is a smart, extensible event-tracking system designed to automatically monitor various event sources (
starting with esports) and notify users across different platforms.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.
